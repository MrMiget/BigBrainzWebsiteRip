		<description><![CDATA[M Ward,

Great questions and comments. Other folks have had a similar perception, and I&#039;m grateful for the chance to address them:

1. &quot;It makes me start all over again when I fail something!&quot; A small error does not restart a whole level. If a student misses one fact, they review one fact. That&#039;s it. But we don&#039;t want ANY student to even FEEL like that&#039;s happening, so let&#039;s break down what&#039;s actually taking place.

If a student is fluent with a fact, they will &quot;know&quot; the answer in less than 1 - 2 seconds, allowing them plenty of time to accurately input the answer. But if a student is only partially fluent, it will take them a while to &quot;remember&quot; the answer, forcing them to rush to input the answer, and leaving them much more likely to make a typing mistake. 

In that scenario they&#039;re clearly not fluent, but they may FEEL like they knew the answer and are being unfairly punished for a simple typing error, but the reality is that their mastery is still developing. Timez Attack very good at judging between a typing error and a lack of mastery.

But even in the case of a pure typing error, the program will simply review the &quot;missed&quot; fact and bring them right back. As part of the review, the missed fact will be integrated and tested along with other facts because reviewing just one fact is a completely short-term exercise and doesn&#039;t actually develop memorization. But even that review is not wasted because while reviewing that fact, we&#039;re also reinforcing any other facts that are borderline.

Mastering all the facts is deeply challenging. Only 12% of students master it by 5th-grade. Even after 24 to 30 hours of teacher instruction, the average student only masters 59% of their facts nationwide. I suppose it makes sense that some students would get a bit frustrated while working their way towards such a vital accomplishment, but we&#039;re doing everything we can to remove even the smallest obstacles for students, so thank you for raising the discussion point. If even one student is hitting a stumbling-block, we need to improve.

#2 &quot;Just drill-and-kill.&quot; This is a curiously derogatory term. Comprehension needs to come before Fluency. But fluency with basic facts will greatly enhance future comprehension of higher-order facts. For example, an educator recently told us that they only want students to memorize facts up to the 5x5 because for 7 x 5 they can simply pull up 2 x 5 and 5 x 5 and then add them together. Well, you CAN do that, but you&#039;re going to be able to learn higher-order concepts much more efficiently if you don&#039;t HAVE to constantly interrupt the learning process to stop and make basic calculations. Successful students need both comprehension AND fluency. To steal a silly sports metaphor, a football player needs to know the offense, and he CAN just hop on one leg, but he&#039;ll be vastly more effective running on both legs. Fluency with single digit facts really needs to be a bare minimum. Kids need to know the alphabet and they need to know their basic facts.

#3. &quot;There is no time for any conceptual thinking. It&#039;s strictly memorization.&quot; Actually, we do a pretty cool job of the conceptual side. For example, 4 + 6 shows 4 balls and six balls, then shows them joining together to add up to 10. Then we reverse-engineer that into fact families of 10 - 4 = 6, starting with 10 balls and subtracting 6 balls from it, etc.

Now, we very quickly get to a point where we ARE focused on recall and that is absolutely the emphasis of the program. You&#039;re entirely right that we are supplemental at this point.

I&#039;ll also throw out that we LOVE to improve and are working furiously on some very cool enhancements for addition.]]></description>
